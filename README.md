- ## Approach 2: Prefix Sum

    - ### Intuition
        The task is to determine how many words, within a specific range of indices, start and end with a vowel. For each query, which provides a range `[left, right]`, we need to count how many words in that range satisfy the condition of starting and ending with a vowel.

        To make this process efficient, we preprocess the list of words and calculate a cumulative count of words that satisfy the condition (i.e., start and end with a vowel). Once this preprocessing is done, each query can be answered in constant time by using the cumulative count data.

    - ### Approach
        1. **Preprocessing Phase**:
            - We first iterate over the list of words and check if each word starts and ends with a vowel. We store this information in a boolean list (`if_Vowel_String`), where each entry is `True` if the word starts and ends with a vowel and `False` otherwise.
        
        2. **Prefix Sum Array**:
            - We construct a cumulative sum array (`vowel_String_Till_Index`), where each entry at index `i` represents the total number of vowel strings from index `0` to index `i`. This allows us to efficiently calculate the number of vowel strings in any range `[left, right]` by taking the difference `vowel_String_Till_Index[right] - vowel_String_Till_Index[left-1]`.
        
        3. **Query Processing**:
            - For each query, the result is computed in constant time by using the cumulative count array. For a query range `[left, right]`, we calculate how many vowel strings are in this range using the precomputed cumulative counts.

    - ### Code Implementation
        - **Python Solution**
            ```python3 []
            class Solution:
                def vowelStrings(self, words: List[str], queries: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
                    # Define the set of vowels for quick lookup
                    vowels = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}
                    
                    # Create a list `if_Vowel_String` that stores whether each word
                    # starts and ends with a vowel. Each entry will be True or False.
                    # The list comprehension checks if the first and last characters of each word are vowels.
                    if_Vowel_String = [
                        True if word[0] in vowels and word[-1] in vowels else False 
                        for word in words
                    ]
                    
                    # Initialize the `vowel_String_Till_Index` list to store the cumulative count
                    # of vowel strings up to each index. This list helps to answer range queries efficiently.
                    vowel_String_Till_Index = [0] * len(words)
                    
                    # For the first word, we directly set whether it is a vowel string or not
                    vowel_String_Till_Index[0] = 1 if if_Vowel_String[0] else 0

                    # Compute the cumulative count of vowel strings up to each index
                    for index in range(1, len(words)):
                        vowel_String_Till_Index[index] = vowel_String_Till_Index[index-1] + (1 if if_Vowel_String[index] else 0)

                    # Initialize an empty list to store the result for each query
                    vowel_String_Count = []
                    
                    # Iterate through each query (which contains a range [l, r])
                    for l, r in queries:
                        # For each query, compute the number of vowel strings in the range [l, r].
                        # This is done using the difference of cumulative counts: 
                        # (vowel_String_Till_Index[r] - vowel_String_Till_Index[l]) 
                        # gives the count in the range [l, r]. We also need to handle the case when l is 0.
                        count = vowel_String_Till_Index[r] - vowel_String_Till_Index[l] + (1 if if_Vowel_String[l] else 0)
                        
                        # Append the result of the query to the `vowel_String_Count` list
                        vowel_String_Count.append(count)

                    # Return the list of counts for all queries
                    return vowel_String_Count
            ```

            ```cpp []
            class Solution {
            public:

                            if_Vowel_String[index] = true;

                    vowel_String_Till_Index[0] = (if_Vowel_String[0]) ? 1 : 0;

                    // Fill the cumulative count array by summing up the number of vowel strings
                    for (int index = 1; index < words.size(); ++index) {
                        vowel_String_Till_Index[index] = vowel_String_Till_Index[index - 1] +

    - ### Time Complexity
        1. **Preprocessing**:
            - The preprocessing phase involves checking each word to see if it starts and ends with a vowel. This takes **$O(n)$** time, where $n$ is the number of words.
            - After that, constructing the cumulative sum array takes **$O(n)$** time as well.

        2. **Query Processing**:
            - Each query is answered in **$O(1)$** time, since we simply take the difference between two values in the cumulative sum array.
            - If there are $m$ queries, answering all queries takes **$O(m)$** time.

            Thus, the total time complexity is **$O(n + m)$**, where $n$ is the number of words and $m$ is the number of queries.

    - ### Space Complexity
        1. **`if_Vowel_String` List**:
            - We need an auxiliary list `if_Vowel_String` of size $n$ to store whether each word starts and ends with a vowel. This takes **$O(n)$** space.

        2. **`vowel_String_Till_Index` List**:
            - We also need an auxiliary list `vowel_String_Till_Index` of size $n$ to store the cumulative count of vowel strings. This also takes **$O(n)$** space.

        3. **Result List**:
            - The result list `vowel_String_Count` stores the count for each query, which takes **$O(m)$** space, where $m$ is the number of queries.

            Thus, the total space complexity is **$O(n + m)$**, where $n$ is the number of words and $m$ is the number of queries.
